Abstract:
> Human language possesses a rich hierarchical structure that allows for meaning to be altered by words spaced far apart within or between sentences. Language hierarchies extend beyond long distance word-level relationships, however, and the sequential dynamics of language and in particular speech, the primary form of expression for language acquisition and transmission, are potentially subject to other physiological constraints. Here, we show that human speech and birdsong share a similar sequential structure indicative of both hierarchical and Markovian organization. We modeled the sequential dynamics of song from multiple songbird species and human speech in multiple languages by analyzing the information content in each signal as a function of the sequential distance between vocal elements. Across short sequence distances, information in speech and birdsong is dominated by an exponential decay, consistent with underlying Markovian processes. At longer sequence distances, the decay in information follows a power law, consistent with underlying hierarchical processes.   Thus, the sequential organization of acoustic elements in two learned vocal communication signals (speech and birdsong) show functionally equivalent dynamics, governed by similar processes. 


The following datasets were used, and need to be manually downloaded for analysis using this code: 

- Speech corpora:
  - Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese
  - Buckeye corpus
  - GECO corpus
  - Italian corpus
- Birdsong datasets
  - European starling vocalizations (to be uploaded to Figshare)
  - Bengalese finch vocalizations (link)
  - Cassin's vireo vocalizations (link)
  - California thrasher vocalizations (link)
